# Mollie's Portfolio
#### Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio! 

This site includes an about me section, a section to showcase work, and a section for contact methods.
The navbar is functional and will take you to each section of the page. There is also a clickable picture
of my module 1 challenge that will take you to the site! Last but not least the page will properly shrink
when the screen is smaller.
